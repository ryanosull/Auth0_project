# README

Hello and welcome to Auth0_project. This app/repo is just for the exploration of and playing with Auth0's SSO/universal login solutions. For now, this is only the frontend/SPA implementation, but will eventually include a full backend/db implementation. Check out the series of related blogs that start here:

## Styles

As I didn't want my app to simply be un-styled log in/out buttons, I had a bit of fun with the CSS. Below are a few useful CSS-related links.

- A keen eye may notice a few classic Porsche colors here, Irish Green and Rubystone Red, which can acutally be purchased as normal paint here: https://www.backdrophome.com/pages/porsche/
    - https://imagecolorpicker.com/en was used to define hex value from above paint sample
- https://dev.to/webdeasy/top-20-css-buttons-animations-f41 and https://uiverse.io/buttons# were used for button inspiration.
- https://coolors.co/ff6666-ccff66-5d2e8c-2ec4b6-f1e8b8 to pick color pallettes for SVG background
- https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/set/free-svg-backgrounds-and-patterns/ was used for the SVG background
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Shade?query=bungee+shade and, of course, Google fonts.
